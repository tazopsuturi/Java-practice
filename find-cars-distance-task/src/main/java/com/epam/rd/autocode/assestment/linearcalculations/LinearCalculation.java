     * The speed of the first car is V1 km/h, the speed of the second car is V2 km/h,

     * if the cars are distancing from each other. The given distance is equal
     * the sum of the initial distance + the general way, which was covered by cars;
     * the general way = time*total speed.

     * Example:
     * <pre>
     * V1 = 90 km/h; V2 = 110 km/h; S = 65 km; T = 3 h  =>  Distance = 665 km
     * V1 = 65.5 km/h; V2 = 90.4 km/h; S = 20.9 km; T = 1.5 h  =>  Distance = 254.75 km
     * V1 = 70 km/h; V2 = 85.6 km/h; S = 32.6 km; T = 2 h  =>  Distance = 343.8 km
